#Use the random module to:
#Generate a random integer between 1 and 10 and store it in a variable called num
#Set a variable called “correct” to the Boolean “False”
#While correct is equal to false, ask the user to guess the number
#If the user guesses the number correctly, change correct to the Boolean “True”

while correct == False:
    guess = int(input("Guess the number: "))
    if guess == num:
