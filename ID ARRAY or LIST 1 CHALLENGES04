#Create a list containing the titles of four TV programmes
#Display them on separate lines
#Ask the user to enter another show and a position they wanted it inserted into the list
#Display the list again, showing all five TY shows in their new positions

#HINT:Ask for the food in separate variables e.g. show |.To pass the data from the variables into the array, put the same variable in the array e.g. TvShow 2 [show 1, show2, show3, show4, show5]
#HINT:You will need to use For loops too

programmes = ["Peaky Blinders", "Spongebob", "Family Guy", "The Simpsons"]

for i in programmes:
    print(i)

index = int(input("Where in the code would you like to put this show?"))
