#Use the random module to:
#Generate a random integer between 1 and 10 and store it in a variable called num
#Set a variable called “correct” to the Boolean “False”
#While correct is equal to false, ask the user to guess the number
#If the user guesses the number correctly, change correct to the Boolean “True”
#Or if the user guesses too high, display “too high”
#Otherwise display “too low”
