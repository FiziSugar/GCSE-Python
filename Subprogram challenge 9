#Subprogram challenge 09 (GCSECS.com)
#upgrade your code in challenge 08 by..
#..asking the user if they want to work..
#..with "circles" or "mathematical times tables"
#If they choose times table, ask them which one
#If they choose e.g. 3 times table, display it
#Be sure to use a for loop for the times table
