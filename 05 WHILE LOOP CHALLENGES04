#Outside the loop, create a variable that controls the loop (this is called a sentryvariable)
#Outside the loop, create a variable called count that is set to 0
#Inside the loop, ask for the name of somebody the user want to invite to a party
#After this display the message “{name} has now been invited”
#add 1 to the count
#Ask if they want to invite somebody else (y/n)
#Keep repeating this until they no longer want to invite anybody else to the party (enter “n”).
#The display how many people they have invited to the party

#I have a feeling I have over complicated this code?
