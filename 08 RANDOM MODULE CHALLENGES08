#Create a variable called score and set it to 0
#Create a count based loop that uses the range function
#In the loop, make an adding maths quiz that asks five questions by randomly generating two whole numbers to make the question e.g.
#Num1 + Num2
#Ask the user to enter the answer
#If they get it right, add a point to their score
#At the end of the quiz, tell them how many they got correct out of five
#HINT, you will need a for loop that uses the range function
import random 
score = 0

for i in range(5):
    num1 = random.randint(1,100)
    num2 = random.randint(1,100)
    correct = num1 + num2 
    question = int(input(f"What is {num1} + {num2} ?: "))
    if question == correct:
        score = score + 1
print("You got", score, "out of 5")
