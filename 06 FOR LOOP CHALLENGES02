#Ask a user to enter their name
#Ask a user to enter a number (as an int)
#The code should display their name the number of times that they entered above
#HINT: use the function “range(n,f)”
#Where, n is a starting number and f is a finished number (f can be a variable)

name = input("Enter your name: ")
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

for i in range(num): #The instructions expect two parameters, when I have only got one. Let me know if this is incorrect and I'll fix it.
