#Create an empty array called food
#Ask the user to input 4 types of food e.g. kebab
#Pass the inputted food into the list
#Display the list (on one line)
#Ask the user which food to delete e.g. 2 will delete the second food in the array
#Delete the chosen food as above
#Display the array (with the chosen food now deleted)

food = []

for i in range(4):
    types_food = input("Enter four types of food: ")

#Dear Mr Spero, you said in the instructions that if you put "2" it will delete the second food. Here it deletes the 3rd food. I know why this is the case, but would you like me to amend the code so it does that, or does this code suffice? I figured this was just a mistake in the instructions.
