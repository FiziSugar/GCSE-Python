#Subprogram challenge 10 (GCSECS.com)
#upgrade your code in challenge 09 by..
#Creating a subprogram that does adding
#Creating a subprogram that does multiplying
#Creating a subprogram that does subtracting
#Creating a subprogram that does division
#Your program should complete a caluculation...
#..then loop back to ask for other calculation to be performed
