#Ask how many people the user wants to invite to a party
#If they enter a number below 10, ask for the names and after each name display“ {name} has been invited”
#If they enter a number which is 10 or higher, display the message “too many people”
#HINT: use the function “range(n,f)”
#Where, n is a starting number and f is a finished number (n and f can be a variable)
